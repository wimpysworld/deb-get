    "body": "Minigalaxy version 0.9.2 is now available. For new users, Minigalaxy is a simple GOG client made for installing and running GOG Linux games. This release is the biggest one yet, containing contributions from 3 new contributors. A breakdown of all the new features and fixes follows below.\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sharkwouter/minigalaxy/0.9.2/screenshot.jpg)\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\nVersion 0.9.2 brings many new features to Minigalaxy:\r\n\r\n- Added a button to installed games which allow you to:\r\n    - Uninstall a game.\r\n    - Open the directory in which the game is installed.\r\n- Added translation support. The following additional languages are now supported:\r\n    - Dutch\r\n    - Taiwanese Mandarin (thanks to s8321414)\r\n- Added offline mode.\r\n- The system's Dosbox and Scummvm installations are now preferred over the ones bundled with games.\r\n- Improved game detection to check in all directories in the installation path.\r\n- Added the option to keep game installers (thanks to Odelpasso).\r\n- Added the option to disable staying logged in (thanks to Odelpasso).\r\n- The preferences menu now uses a file picker for setting the installation path (thanks to Odelpasso).\r\n- Startup time has been reduced.\r\n- Games which aren't installed are now grayed out.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\nThis version also fixes some bugs which you may have seen in a previous release:\r\n\r\n- Fixed FTL not being able to start.\r\n- Fixed issue with thumbnails sometimes not fully loading.\r\n- Fixed potential crash after logging in the first time.\r\n- Fixed close button on about window not working.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nAs usual a deb file for installing this release on Debian and Ubuntu is listed below. Manjaro and Arch users can use the [official AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/minigalaxy/).\r\n\r\nPackages for Fedora, openSUSE and Gentoo will hopefully be updated in the coming days. See the [README](https://github.com/sharkwouter/minigalaxy/) for info on how to install them."
