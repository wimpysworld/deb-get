.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Introduction
.PP
\f[V]deb-get\f[R] makes it easy to install and update \f[V].debs\f[R]
published in 3rd party apt repositories or made available via direct
download on websites or GitHub release pages.
.SS Install
.PP
Use \f[V]deb-get\f[R] to install \f[V]deb-get\f[R].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sudo apt install curl
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wimpysworld/deb-get/main/deb-get | sudo -E bash -s install deb-get
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Alternatively, you can download the \f[V].deb\f[R] of \f[V]deb-get\f[R]
from the releases
page (https://github.com/wimpysworld/deb-get/releases/latest) and
install it manually with
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sudo apt-get install ./path/to/deb-get_<version>.deb
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Usage
.PP
Here\[cq]s an example of how to install Google Chrome.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
deb-get install google-chrome-stable
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You can see what applications are supported by using
\f[V]deb-get list\f[R] or you can search the available applications with
\f[V]deb-get search <app>\f[R].
.PP
You can upgrade packages installed using \f[V]deb-get\f[R] by running
\f[V]deb-get upgrade\f[R].
.SS Why?
.PP
3rd party apt repositories exist.
They are not going away.
.PP
Some application vendors and projects express their support for
Debian/Ubuntu by publishing \f[V].debs\f[R] of their software as direct
downloads or via their own apt repositories.
\f[V]deb-get\f[R] makes it easy to find, install and update
\f[V].debs\f[R] published in this way.
.IP \[bu] 2
Perhaps you want to use software that is not (yet) officially packaged
for Debian/Ubuntu.
.IP \[bu] 2
Perhaps you want to use software that is fast moving and newer versions
are available from the vendor/project.
.IP \[bu] 2
Perhaps you want to use some non-free software that Debian/Ubuntu cannot
distribute due to licensing restrictions.
.PP
\f[V]deb-get\f[R] tries to remedy this by providing a curated index of
software available for Ubuntu that is published by the project or
vendor.
\f[V]deb-get\f[R] is inspired by Software Boutique, a graphical
application I co-authored that does much the same thing and has been
included in Ubuntu MATE (https://ubuntu-mate.org) since 2015.
.SS Supported Software

The software below can be installed, updated and removed using
\f[V]deb-get\f[R].

.SS How do package updates work?
.SS 3rd party apt repositories and PPAs
.PP
If packages are available via a 3rd party \f[V]apt\f[R] repository or a
Launchpad PPA , then those packages will be updated/upgraded when using
\f[V]apt-get update\f[R] and \f[V]apt-get upgrade\f[R].
.SS GitHub Releases and direct downloads
.PP
For \f[V].deb\f[R] packages that are only available via GitHub Releases
or direct download , then those packages can only be updated/upgrade by
using \f[V]deb-get update\f[R] and \f[V]deb-get upgrade\f[R].
.SS GitHub API Rate Limits
.PP
\f[V]deb-get\f[R] uses the GitHub REST
API (https://docs.github.com/en/rest) for some functionality when
applications are provided via GitHub Releases and for unauthenticated
interactions this API is
rate-limited (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting)
to 60 calls per hour per source (IP Address).
This is vital for keeping the API responsive and available to all users,
but can be inconvenient if you have a lot of GitHub releases being
handled by \f[V]deb-get\f[R] (or need to update several times in a short
period to test your contribution) and will result in, for example,
temporary failures to be able to upgrade or install applications via
GitHub Releases .
.PP
If you have a GitHub account you can authenticate your GitHub API usage
to increase your rate-limit to 5000 requests per hour per authenticated
user.
To do this you will need to use a Personal Access Token
(PAT) (https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
Once you have created a token within GitHub (or identified an
appropriate existing token) you should insert it into an environment
variable (\f[V]DEBGET_TOKEN\f[R]) for \f[V]deb-get\f[R] to pick up and
use to authenticate to the GitHub API.
.PP
e.g.:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export DEBGET_TOKEN=<my-secret-token>
deb-get update
deb-get upgrade
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Adding Software
.PP
For information on what is acceptable as suggestion for new packages and
instructions on how to open a PR to add a new package, head to
CONTRIBUTING.
.SS Custom User Includes \f[V]/etc/deb-get.d/\f[R]
.PP
As a more advanced feature, it\[cq]s now possible to also add your own
local customizations or overrides.
And supplement the supplied list of official packages.
This feature is especially useful to that your local copy of the
\f[V]deb-get\f[R] tool can remain unmodified and always be kept fully up
to date.
By moving your customizations out in a seperate folder away from the
main \f[V]deb-get\f[R] script.
.PP
Typically either because:
.IP "1." 3
You are waiting on a pending request for a new software package.
Which has been submitted for consideration.
But which has not been reviewed / accepted / merged / released yet.
.IP "2." 3
Or because you need to add something which does not meet any of the
general guidelines in the previous section \[ha]\[ha] detailed above,
for whatever various reason(s).
.PP
How to use:
.IP \[bu] 2
Manually create the folder \f[V]/etc/deb-get.d/\f[R] if not exist
already.
By default \f[V]deb-get\f[R] does not create this folder unless your
specific distribution has packaged it that way.
.IP \[bu] 2
Can also create any arbitrary nested sub-folder structure within
\f[V]/etc/deb-get.d/**/*\f[R] main folder
.IP \[bu] 2
Any files within this tree will be bash sourced in alphabetical order
e.g.\ \f[V]. /etc/deb-get.d/01-pending-merge/10-appname1\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Your user custom \f[V]deb_*\f[R] functions are then loaded directly
after the last \f[V]deb_*()\f[R] package declarations that officially
come with \f[V]deb-get\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Recommendation message printed for any new user added deb_* functions.
With a URL link to open a request.
.IP \[bu] 2
Warning messages are then also printed for any conflicts detected.
For overriden functions (of same name), which then take priority over
existing official deb-get apps.
.PP
For the last situation, this is most often meant as a helpful reminder
to remove your custom declaration once it has been successfully merged
upstream into the official \f[V]deb-get\f[R] tool.
So after \f[V]deb-get\f[R] updates itself you are properly notified.
And can avoid keeping lots of duplite functions around.
.PP
We really hope that you will enjoy the convenience and flexibility of
the new user overrides feature.
So please consider in return to open new issues or pull requests (here
on github), for any new \f[V]deb_*()\f[R] functions / packages you
create!
So that we can share those back with the wider community.
Many thanks for your consideration!
